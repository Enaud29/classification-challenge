### Summary
After loading in the data I predict which model will perform better. I then create a y label which is extracted from the spam column and a X label which is the remaining columns. 0 in the spam column means the message is real 1 means the message is spam. I split the data into training and testing sets. Next I fit the model using train_test_split. Next I scaled the data using StandardScaler. Finally I used Logistic Regression and Random orest Classifier to make predictions. In the end the Random Forest Classifier performed better because it had a higher accuracy score.
